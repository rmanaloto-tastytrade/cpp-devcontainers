- Current flow builds base inside every permutation job and re-runs bake setup per matrix entry; you can instead run one `docker/bake-action@v6` with `targets: base,matrix` (or a new `group "all"`) so Buildx builds base once and reuses the same builder cache across all permutations in a single job.
- If you want to keep multiple jobs, add a dedicated `build-base` job that `bake --push`es `base`+cache to GHCR; permutation jobs can switch to `pull:true` and skip the local base rebuild.
- Drop the `case` mapping step by putting `target` in the strategy matrix (e.g., `{permutation: gcc14-clang21, target: devcontainer_gcc14_clang_qual}`) and feed `${{ matrix.target }}` directly into metadata/bake—less glue, fewer guard points.
- Consider moving variant differences to bake-time args instead of duplicated targets (e.g., matrix over `{gcc,clang_variant,enable_p2996}` and use `set:` to inject args). That keeps the HCL lean and lets you expand permutations without editing the file.
- You’re already using the right Docker actions (setup-buildx/login/metadata/bake); nothing obvious missing. Only optional add-on would be a single `bake` invocation with multi-target cache sharing as above for simplicity and speed.
