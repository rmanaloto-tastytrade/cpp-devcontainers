Okay, I will review the latest changes to your `cpp-devcontainers` setup. The user is asking for a review of their devcontainer build process, which is intended to be GHCR-only.

My investigation will focus on identifying any remaining risks of pulling from Docker Hub and checking for missing GHCR fallbacks. If I find any issues, I will propose fixes for them.

I will start by getting an overview of your project's devcontainer and CI/CD configuration.
